I am a senior postdoctoral research scientist at the University of Oxford.
I am based in the [Big Data Institute](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk) and am a member of the [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk) group in the Department of Statistics.
I received my PhD from the University of British Columbia under the supervision of [Sohrab Shah](http://shahlab.ca).

# Research

My research is primarily focused on the development and application of statistical and machine learning methods for analysing cancer omics data.
The methods I develop leverage probabilistic graphical models and non-parametric Bayesian methods to extract biologically interpretable quantities from complex datasets.
I am also interested in developing computationally efficient inference algorithms to fit these models.
I am particularly interested in variational and sequential Monte Carlo methods.
These two themes support the ultimate goal of my research which is to understand evolutionary cancer biology.
