I am senior postdoctoral research scientist in University of Oxford Big Data Institute with affiliations to the Department of Statistics and Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research.
I develop computational and statistical methods to leverage high throughput sequencing data to study cancer genomes.

# Research

My research is primarily focused on the development and application of statistical methods for analysing cancer genomics data.
I am particularly interested in developing principled statistical analysis of data sets using probabilistic graphical models and non-parametric Bayesian inference.
I am also interested in efficient algorithms for inference including variational methods and sequential Monte Carlo methods.
