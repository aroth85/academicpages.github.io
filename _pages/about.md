I am senior postdoctoral research scientist based in the University of Oxford Big Data Institute with affiliations to the Department of Statistics and Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research.
I develop computational and statistical methods to leverage high throughput sequencing data to study cancer genomes.

# Research

My research is primarily focused on the development and application of statistical and machine learning methods for analysing cancer genomics data.
I am particularly interested in probabilistic graphical models and non-parametric Bayesian inference.
I am also interested in efficient algorithms for inference such as variational methods and sequential Monte Carlo methods.
